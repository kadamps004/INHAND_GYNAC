#Live Scoring App

This project is based on updating live score of any sport during national sports events of COEP i.e. ZEST. It includes two apps one for client and one for admin. Admin will update the score of the matches parallely being played , while this updated score will now be visible on the client app . This app will thereby allow all spectators to know the score of matches being parallely played .
